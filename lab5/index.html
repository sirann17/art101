					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I think the challenge of this lab is typing javascript for the first time, where the syntaxes are a lot different from css and html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest problem was I think I messed up my code somewhere and my lab 5 website crashed, where it only showed a plain white screen. I solved this problem by looking back the installfest, found Wes's original repo and copied the original html and js codes so I could restart. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab taught me the importance of any tiny change I make to my code will affect my results.  </p>
