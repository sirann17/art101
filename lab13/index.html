					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to create loops for each number under certain conditions.</p>
			</div>

                <div id="problem"></div>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was able to get my numbers loop 1 to 200 but all of them printed "Fizz!". However, when I checked the console, it was able to function properly with "Boom,""Buzz" and combined. Then, the numbers that were not multiples of 3,5,7 did not appear on the page. After many trial and errors, I resolved everything by placing the <"br">code under each line and added additional codes for multiples of 15, 35, 21 to make everything work.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
                <div id="reflection"></div>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I was able to learn a lot about loops from this assignment because I was stuck on this lab for a long time. I have changed and edited many of the code to make it work and I have learned a lot from that process.</p>
