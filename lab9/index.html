			<h1>Lab 9</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
                <div id="challenge"></div>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is understanding jQuery and libraries.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
                <div id="problem"></div>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble in displaying the button on my page and then I realized my id had capitalization but I did not capitalize in my javascript code. One major problem we encountered was making the button in the style of my .special from css. We resolved it by putting the .special in site.css instead of lab.css. I am guessing there is a problem in linking my lab.css file or there is an overlap that caused this error. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
                <div id="reflection"></div>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I have gotten a good introduction to jQuery and library but I think I would still need more time in remembering the purpose of " $("#") ".</p>
